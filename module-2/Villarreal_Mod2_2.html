	<h2>"About My Town and Me"</h2>
	
	<p class="intro">
	Hi, I am Robert Villarreal, I live in the town of New Braunfels located in Texas just outside of San Antonio. 
	In school as a child, it was pointed out that this is a German town almost every day. 
	In high school I got in trouble when I would pointed out, if you want to go by history then this is Mexico, my teacher did not like that. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The town is best known for Schlitterbahn water park if you had a job in high school, you at least worked one summer. 
	I worked there for five summer's I learned a lot about managing an area and handling customers. 
	Schlitterbahn is a German word it means slippery road in English sounds fitting for a waterpark with a lot of tube rides. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I have worked at Walmart and Sam's club distribution center for the past 24 years. 
	I am trained at every job in the building, and I am the trainer for the lifts, loaders, unloaders, and verifiers. 
	My favorite part of my job is problem solving. 
	Whenever we have an issue, I tend to deal with it. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I have a few hobbies. First off, I am a toy collector, I collect Transformers, GI Joe, Thunder Cats and Star Wars. 
	My collection is mint inbox. My other hobby is lumped in with my toy collection because it is autograph collecting. 
	A few of which are Funko pop's that are signed I almost have all the stranger things kids I am missing Max. 
	<span class="sentence">
	My favorite autograph is a Robert England signed Freddy Krueger glove replica of the first Nightmare on Elm Street.
	</span> 
	I also do 3D printing I have a total of six printers three filament printer’s and three resin printers.
