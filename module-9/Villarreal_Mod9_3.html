	<p class="intro">	
BLAKE (loudly, to everyone): Let me have your attention for a moment. So you’re talking about what? 
You’re talking about [he puts out his cigarette] bitching about that sale you shot, some <span id="span1">_______</span> that doesn’t want to buy, 
somebody that doesn’t want what you’re selling, some <span id="span2">_______</span> you’re trying to screw, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (to Williamson): Let’s talk about something important. Are they all here?
</p>
<p>
WILLIAMSON: All but one.
</p>
<p>
BLAKE: Well, I’m going anyway.
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (to everyone): Let’s talk about something <span id="span3">_______</span>!
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (to Levene, who is attempting to pour himself a cup of coffee): Put. That coffee. Down! Coffee’s for closers only.
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (to Levene): Do you think I’m fucking with you?
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (to Levene): I am not fucking with you. I’m here from downtown. I’m here from Mitch and Murray.
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (to the entire office): And I’m here on a mission of mercy!
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (to Levene): Your name’s Levene?
</p>
<p>
Levene: Yeah.
</p>
<p>
Blake: You call yourself a salesman, you, son of a bitch?
</p>
<p>
MOSS: I don’t gotta listen to this shit.
</p>
<p>
BLAKE: You certainly don’t, pal.
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (still to Moss): ’Cause the good news is you’re <span id="span4">_____</span>.
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (to Moss, then to everyone): The bad news is you’ve got, all you got, just one week to regain your jobs, starting tonight. Starting with tonight’s sit.
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (to everyone): Oh, have I got your attention now?
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (still to everyone): Good. ’Cause we’re adding a little something to this month’s sales contest. As you all know, first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado.
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (still to everyone): Anyone want to see second prize? Second prize’s a set of steak knives.
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (still to everyone): Third prize is you’re fired.
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (still to everyone): You get the picture? Are you laughing now? You got leads. Mitch and Murray paid good money. Get their names to sell them!
</p>
<p>
BLAKE (still to everyone): You can’t close the leads you’re given, you can’t close shit, you ARE shit. Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it, ’cause you are going out!
